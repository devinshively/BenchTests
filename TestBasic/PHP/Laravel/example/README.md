Took a little more than an hour to get everything up and running. Reminds me of Grails, though Grails was easier and required less 
boilerplate to get up and running. Had to install php with mcrypt using homebrew. A lot better than rolling your own 
rest api in PHP. When all is said and done, Grails was far easier and would be better for RAD.
