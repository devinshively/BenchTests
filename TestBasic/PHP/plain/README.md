In total took about 2 - 3 hours. I must admit I do not like PHP. PHP is ugly. It is a best suited for templating. Since mac comes with php installed, it didnâ€™t include the postgres driver. I had to reinstall it with the pdo postgres flag.
I want to test it running nginx fpm and also with hhvm. https://github.com/tengyifei/openshift-cartridge-nginx-hhvm
